QuickBooks PHP DevKit
=====================

QuickBooks integration support for PHP 5.x+ 
 
The package you've downloaded contains code and documentation for connecting various versions and editions of QuickBooks to PHP, allowing your PHP applications to do fancy things like:

- Automatically send orders placed on your website to QuickBooks 
- Charge credit cards using the QuickBooks Merchant Service
- Connect to Intuit Anywhere / the Intuit Partner Platform and access IDS Services  
- Get access to QuickBooks reports 
- Pull information out of QuickBooks and display it online 
- Connect to all Microsoft Windows versions of QuickBooks
- Connect to QuickBooks Online Edition
- etc. etc. etc.

Almost anything you can do in the QuickBooks GUI, in QuickBooks Online Edition, and with QuickBooks Merchant Service can be accomplished via this framework.
